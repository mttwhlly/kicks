## Clean Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The codebase is organized into the following layers:

### Core Layer
- Contains business logic and domain models
- Independent of frameworks and libraries
- Located in `src/core/`

### Infrastructure Layer
- Implements data access and external services
- Depends on the core layer but not on the presentation layer
- Located in `src/infrastructure/`

### Presentation Layer
- Contains all UI components and React-specific code
- Depends on the core layer but not directly on the infrastructure layer
- Located in `src/presentation/`

### Common Layer
- Contains shared utilities, constants, and types
- Used by all other layers
- Located in `src/common/`

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Running for Production

Run a production build:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Storybook

Start the Storybook development server:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
